# KeraDisk Â· Harmonic Substrate Interface

**The KeraDisk is a passive, field-responsive interface designed for non-invasive neural coherence modulation, psionic signal entrainment, and harmonic computing substrate research.**

This system operates without digital microcontrollers, batteries, or conventional chipsets. It is activated and modulated through breath, field pressure, light entrainment, and internal phase transitions.

## âœ¦ Core Principles

- **Pressure-Activated Ionic Core**  
  Piezoelectric + ferroelectric gel medium responds to intentional pressure or field resonance shifts.

- **Triple-Phase Induction Coils**  
  Creates a harmonically zeroed zone until coherent field input is applied.

- **Graphene / Tourmaline Architecture**  
  Reduced graphene oxide suspensions layered with piezo-tuned tourmaline create a dynamic charge envelope.

- **Resonant Crystal Layering**  
  External and internal crystal nodules (Herkimer, fluorite, labradorite) allow field guidance and frequency band expansion.

## âœ¦ Intent

The KeraDisk is not a product. It is a living substrate architecture for:
- Non-invasive neural interface systems  
- Psionic and field-based control platforms  
- Resonance-based logic systems (post-Boolean)  
- Harmonic biofield computing  
- Passive environmental sensors  

It is offered in open form for builders, scientists, and harmonic explorers.
